# Online_Hotel_Reservation_System
The main objective of this project is to create an efficient database and manage requests for online hotel reservations. The online reservation system aims at the maintenance  and management of different hotels present in different parts of the world. The system provides  information about different hotels that are available and their status specific to availability. We  try to provide a single web app where â€“ users can book rooms in a particular area based on the  available hotels in a particular locality, hotel managers can update hotel details and general  public can register to rent their homes.
